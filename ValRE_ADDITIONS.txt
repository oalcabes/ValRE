
ValRE EDITS
===========

THIS DOCUMENT HAS NOTES FOR ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE TO ALTER THE ValRE CODE. READ BELOW IF ValRE
IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY AND YOU NEED TO EDIT IT.

what my code does:
- reads in names of all available model output files
- extracts files between given start and end dates
- extracts values from model output for each date
- checks if there's observational output for each model date, and if there isn't goes into the GOES database and extracts it
- extracts corresponding values from observational output for each given model output
- compares observed and forecasted all clear to generate metrics
- uses other values (ex. peak intensity, forecast probabilities, etc.) to create verification graphs
- prints reports in PDF and/or JSON formats
  - note: plots are included in the PDF report, but not in the JSON report. Individual PNG files of plots can be found in the
  validation_reports/figures folder.

ValRE Assumptions
=================
- all output files have some string of the date in them in the forms: YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY_MM_DD
- all output files are in the JSON form created by the CCMC (this example format can be found in
  ref_files/example_sepscoreboard_json_file_v20190228.json - however, please do not move/alter this file from its current directory as     ValRE may need to read it in. If you need to use it please just copy it)
- if an observed event starts before midnight but the model doesn't pick it up until after midnight, ValRE will interpret
  such an event as one miss and one hit as opposed to one late hit. If you know about such an event, I suggest merging the two files
  into one, which should fix the problem
- ValRE currently has no capability for an event in which the primary GOES instrument changes mid-event. It may crash or read
  the observed data incorrectly (although it's possible the code would still run fine, but check it). In order to account for such an   
  event, it may make sense to manually input the backup instrument.

Likely Edits
============
1. NOT LOADING IN FILES CORRECTLY: There are a few things you may need to change in the code if it isn't loading in your files 
correctly, and you can't just change your output files.
   a. INPUT FILES: to load in your input files, you may need to change the format of the datestring that is in the file name. If
   it is necessary to change this in the actual code as opposed to just changing your files, you can edit the date_range function
   lines:
        d2_str1 = str(d2)
        d2_str2 = d2.strftime('%Y_%m_%d')
        # print(d2)
        for f in all_files:
            if d2_str1 in str(f) or d2_str2 in str(f):
    If you need to add a new date format, simply create d2_str3 = d2.strftime('your new format'), and append the line
    if d2_str1 in str(f) or d2_str2 in str(f): --> if d2_str1 in str(f) or d2_str2 in str(f) or d3_str3 in str(f):
    b. OUTPUT FILES: Similarly to input files, if you're having problems loading your output files and need to change the form of the
    datestring, you can alter the following lines in the main function of the code:    
        if str(mod_start_time.date()) in str(obs_files) or mod_start_time.strftime('%Y_%m_%d') in str(obs_files):
           for obs_f in obs_files:
               if str(mod_start_time.date()) in str(obs_f) or mod_start_time.strftime('%Y_%m_%d') in str(obs_f):
     and again, you can just add another or statement in both if statements with"
          mod_start_time.strftime(your format) in str(obs_f)

   
   
   
 some ideas for new things I could do with ValRE
 ===============================================
 - do some calculations w peak intensity differences
 - make it possible to add to a previous validation report by adding all the hits and misses from a previous report to a new one
