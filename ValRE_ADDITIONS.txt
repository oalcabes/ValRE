===========

THIS DOCUMENT HAS NOTES FOR ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE TO ALTER THE ValRE CODE. READ BELOW IF ValRE
IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY AND YOU NEED TO EDIT IT.

what my code does:
- reads in names of all available model output files
- extracts files between given start and end dates
- extracts values from model output for each date
- checks if there's observational output for each model date, and if there isn't goes into the GOES database and extracts it
- extracts corresponding values from observational output for each given model output
- compares observed and forecasted all clear to generate metrics
- uses other values (ex. peak intensity, forecast probabilities, etc.) to create verification graphs
- prints reports in PDF and/or JSON formats
  - note: plots are included in the PDF report, but not in the JSON report. Individual PNG files of plots can be found in the
  validation_reports/figures folder.

ValRE Assumptions
=================
- all output files have some string of the date in them in the forms: YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY_MM_DD
-

Likely Edits
============
1. NOT LOADING IN FILES CORRECTLY: There are a few things you may need to change in the code if it isn't loading in your files correctly.
   a. INPUT FILES: to load in your input files, you may need to change the format of the datestring that is in the file name. If
   it is necessary to change this in the actual code as opposed to just changing your files, you can look at line # **SOMETHING
   




***RIGHT NOW: IF AN ONGOING EVENT IS HAPPENING VALIDATION READS IT AS A YES
***HERES WHAT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT WOULD BE: IF AN OBSERVED EVENT STARTS BEFORE MIDNIGHT BUT THE MODEL
DOESN'T PICK IT UP UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT AND ALL THE FILES ARE SPLIT BY DAYS, THAT WOULD READ AS
ONE MISS AND ONE HIT INSTEAD OF JUST ONE LATE HIT. IF YOU KNOW ABOUT SUCH AN EVENT IN ADVANCE, I WOULD SUGGEST
MERGING THE FILES OF BOTH DAYS SO THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

**WHAT HAPPENS IF AN INSTRUMENT CHANGES IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EVENT????
