what my code does:
-reads in model files **may be worth it to change this to only extract chosen dates and not read in all
-extracts files from chosen dates
-extracts values from model output for each date
-checks if there's observational output for each model date, and if there isn't uses katie's code to create it
-extracts values from observational output for each model output that exists
-compares all clear stuff to each other to generate metrics
-uses other values to create verification graphs
-prints everything to reports

THIS DOCUMENT HAS NOTES FOR ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE TO ALTER THE ValRE CODE. READ BELOW IF ValRE
IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY AND YOU NEED TO EDIT IT.

ValRE Assumptions
=================
- all output files have some string of the date in them in the forms: YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY_MM_DD
-





***RIGHT NOW: IF AN ONGOING EVENT IS HAPPENING VALIDATION READS IT AS A YES
***HERES WHAT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT WOULD BE: IF AN OBSERVED EVENT STARTS BEFORE MIDNIGHT BUT THE MODEL
DOESN'T PICK IT UP UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT AND ALL THE FILES ARE SPLIT BY DAYS, THAT WOULD READ AS
ONE MISS AND ONE HIT INSTEAD OF JUST ONE LATE HIT. IF YOU KNOW ABOUT SUCH AN EVENT IN ADVANCE, I WOULD SUGGEST
MERGING THE FILES OF BOTH DAYS SO THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

**WHAT HAPPENS IF AN INSTRUMENT CHANGES IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EVENT????
