def all_program_info(): #only for documentation purposes
    """This program will calculate various useful pieces of operational
    information about SEP events from GOES-08, -10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15
    data and the SEPEM (RSDv2) dataset.

    SEP event values are always calculated for threshold definitions:
        >10 MeV exceeds 10 pfu
        >100 MeV exceed 1 pfu

    The user may add an additional threshold through the command line.
    This program will check if data is already present in a 'data' directory. If
    not, GOES data will be automatically downloaded from NOAA ftp site. SEPEM
    (RSDv2) data must be downloaded by the user and unzipped inside the 'data'
    directory. Because the SEPEM data set is so large (every 5 minutes from 1974
    to 2015), the program will break up the data into yearly files for faster
    reading.

    The values calculated here are important for space radiation operations:
       Onset time, i.e. time to cross thresholds
       Peak intensity
       Time of peak intensity
       Rise time (onset to peak)
       End time, i.e. fall below 0.85*threshold for 3 points (15 mins for GOES)
       Duration
       Event-integrated fluences

    User may choose differential proton fluxes (e.g. [MeV s sr cm^2]^-1) or
    integral fluxes (e.g. [s sr cm^2]^-1). The program has no internal checks or
    requirements on units - EXCEPT FOR THE THRESHOLD DEFINITIONS OF >10, 10
    and >100, 1. If you change those thresholds in the main program accordingly,
    you should be able to use other units. Also, all of the plots and messages
    refer to MeV, pfu, and cm.

    If a previous event is ongoing and the specified time period starts with a
    threshold already crossed, you may try to set the --DetectPreviousEvent
    flag. If the flux drops below threshold before the next event starts, the
    program will identify the second event. This will only work if the
    threshold is already crossed for the very first time in your specified
    time period, and if the flux drops below threshold before the next event
    starts.

    RUN CODE FROM COMMAND LINE (put on one line), e.g.:
    python3 operational_sep_quantities.py --StartDate 2012-05-17
        --EndDate '2012-05-19 12:00:00' --Experiment GOES-13
        --FluxType integral --showplot

    RUN CODE FROM COMMAND FOR USER DATA SET (put on one line), e.g.:
    python3 operational_sep_quantities.py --StartDate 2012-05-17
        --EndDate '2012-05-19 12:00:00' --Experiment user --ModelName MyModel
        --UserFile MyFluxes.txt --FluxType integral --showplot

    RUN CODE IMPORTED INTO ANOTHER PYTHON PROGRAM, e.g.:
    import operational_sep_quantities as sep
    start_date = '2012-05-17'
    end_date = '2012-05-19 12:00:00'
    experiment = 'GOES-13'
    flux_type = 'integral'
    model_name = '' #if experiment is user, set model_name to describe data set
    user_file = '' #if experiment is user, specify filename containing fluxes
    showplot = True  #Turn to False if don't want to see plots
    detect_prev_event = True  #Helps if previous event causes high intensities
    threshold = '100,1' #default; modify to add a threshold to 10,10 and 100,1
    sep.run_all(start_date, end_date, experiment, flux_type, model_name,
        user_file, showplot, detect_prev_event, threshold)

    Set the desired directory locations for the data and output at the beginning
    of the program in datapath and outpath. Defaults are 'data' and 'output'.

    In order to calculate the fluence, the program determines time_resolution
    (seconds) from two (fairly random) data points at the start of the SEP
    event. GOES and SEPEM data sets have a time resolution of 5 minutes. If the
    user wishes to use a data set with measurements at irregular times, then the
    subroutine calculate_fluence should be modified.

    OUTPUT: This program outputs 3 to 4 files, 1 per defined threshold plus
    a summary file containing all of the values calculated for each threshold.
    A file named as e.g. fluence_GOES-13_differential_gt10_2012_3_7.csv contains
    the event-integrated fluence for each energy channel using the specified
    threshold (gt10) to determine start and stop times.
    A file named as e.g. sep_values_GOES-13_differential_2012_3_7.csv contains
    start time, peak flux, etc, for each of the defined thresholds.

    Added functionality to ouput the >10 MeV and >100 MeV time series for the
    date range input by the user. If the original data were integral fluxes,
    then the output files simply contain the >10 and >100 MeV time series from
    the input files. If the original data were differential fluxes, then the
    estimated >10 and >100 MeV fluxes are output as time series.

    USER INPUT DATA SETS: Users may input their own data set. For example, if an
    SEP modeler would like to feed their own intensity time series into this
    code and calculate all values in exactly the same way they were calculated
    for data, it is possible to do that. Fluxes should be in units of
    1/[MeV cm^2 s sr] or 1/[cm^2 s sr] and energy channels in MeV for the plot
    labels to be correct. You can use any units, as long as you are consistent
    with energy units in energy channel/bin definition and in fluxes and you
    MODIFY THE THRESHOLD VALUES TO REFLECT YOUR UNITS. You may then want to
    modify plot labels accordingly if not using MeV and cm.
    NOTE: The first column in your flux file is assumed to be time in format
    YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. IMPORTANT FORMATTING!!
    NOTE: The flux file may contain header lines that start with a hash #,
    including blank lines.
    NOTE: Any bad or missing fluxes must be indicated by a negative value.
    NOTE: Put your flux file into the "datapath" directory.
    NOTE: Please use only differential or integral channels. Please do not mix
    them. You may have one integral channel in the last bin, as this is the way
    HEPAD works and the code has been written to include that HEPAD >700 MeV
    bin along with lower differential channels.

    USER VARIABLES: The user must modify the following variables at the very
    top of the code (around line 30):
        user_col - identify columns in your file containing fluxes to analyze;
                even if your delimeter is white space, consider the date-time
                column as one single column. SET AT TOP OF CODE.
        user_delim - delimeter between columns, e.g. " " or ","   Use " " for
                any amount of whitespace. SET AT TOP OF CODE.
        user_energy_bins - define your energy bins at the top of the code in the
                variable user_energy_bins. Follow the format in the subroutine
                define_energy_bins. SET AT TOP OF CODE.
        user_fname - specify the name of the file containing the fluxes
                through an argument in the command line. --UserFile  The
                user_fname variable will be updated with that filename. ARGUMENT
        time_resolution - will be calculated using two time points in your file;
                if you have irregular time measurements, calculate_fluence()
                must be modified/rewritten. AUTOMATICALLY DETERMINED.

       Group to determine actions that should be taken during an SEP event are:
            >10 MeV proton flux exceeds 10 pfu (1/[cm^2 s sr])
            >100 MeV proton flux exceeds 1 pfu (1/[cm^2 s sr])
       If the user input differential flux, then the program has converted it
       to integral fluxes to calculate the integral threshold crossings.
       If the user selected fluxes that were already integral fluxes, then
       the correct channel was identified to determine these crossings.
       GOES and SEPEM data have a 5 minute time resolution, so initial
       crossings are accurate to 5 minutes.
       This program also calculates peak flux and time of peak flux for time
       period specified by user. It then calculates rise time by comparing:
       rise time = time of peak flux - threshold crossing time
       If no thresholds are crossed during specified time period, peak time
       and rise time will be 0.
       The event end time is much more subjective. For this program, I follow
       the code that officially calls the end of an event when SRAG supports
       ISS operations. When the flux has three consecutive points (15 minutes
       of GOES data) below 0.85*threshold, then the event is ended. The end time
       is corrected back to the first of the three data points. This end
       criteria has no physics basis. It simply ensures that a new event will
       not erroneously begin within the SRAG SEP alarm code due to flux
       fluctuations around threshold as the SEP flux decays away slowly.
       If the time period specified by the user ends before the event falls
       below 0.85*threshold, then the event_end_time is set to the last time
       in the specified time range. The program will give a message indicating
       that the user may want to extend the requested time frame in order to
       better-capture the end of the event.
